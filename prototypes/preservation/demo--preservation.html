				<p>The New York Public Library has one of the oldest, largest, and most comprehensive institutional preservation programs in the United States, with activities dating back to the 1911 opening of the landmark Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.</p>
				<p>The Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division cares for the Library’s permanent assets in all formats housed in more than ninety-one buildings in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, as well as a high-density storage facility in New Jersey.</p>
 				<p>The Division preserves both the artifacts that comprise the Library’s vast and diverse collections as well as their intellectual content. The work done by Preservation Division staff significantly contributes to the long-term survival of the Library’s renowned collections held for public access and use.</p>
