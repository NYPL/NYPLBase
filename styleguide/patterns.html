		<h1>NYPL Design Patterns</h1>
		<p>This is a page of "patterns," which are chunks of content designed for a particular display purpose. I'm still refining (and adding!) a lot of patterns to Base, so while this page might sometimes look like a hot mess, it's a fairly accurate snapshot of all the classes and code working together.</p>
		
		<p class="unicorns">(Note to self: make sure to test patterns using light text on dark bg)</p>

<!-- D11N FOR PATTERNS, TO BE DISPLAYED HERE LATER -->

<!--

NAV
use the .nav class on the ul or ol container
extend with:
.nav--banner (centers)
.nav--stacked (vertical)
.nav--fit (100%)
.nav--keywords (commas)

PRIMARY, SECONDARY, TERTIARY, RELATED SECTIONS
max width is desktop
combined w/ body.grid--center, that means section centers itself
extend .grid__item

HDG
any element that gets .hdg (shd prob always be a hed or span) gets NYPL heading style

CHUNKS
are always divs containing content
(should probably extend .grid__item)
there are .chunk, .chunk__list, .chunk__list--icon


HELPERS
.read-more
.callout
.img--left/right/center

-->

<!--

MEDIA OBJECT: use in tier patterns? (this variable is set to true for now)
we can also use the .img--right etc classes directly on the images,
but that's not semantic if the media is not an image

ex.)

	<div class="media">
		<img src="../img/demo/photo_Deli.jpg" alt="" class="media__img one-third">
		<p class=media__body>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
		sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
