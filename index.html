STEPS FOR FINISHING THIS STYLE GUIDE PAGE:
		0. fill in the markup below, compile SCSS, look at it in the browser as is.
		
		1. pick an element
		
		2. read the Inuit default code that affects that element.
			(ie. the Inuit-specified selectors/classes!)
		
		3. adjust as needed, turn adjustments into custom NYPL overrides.
			(ex. mixins, probably with Inuit extensions)
		
		4. put overrides for existing Inuit variables in "_vars.scss", also turn on/off objects.
		4a.	put new patterns, plus treatments, into /ui directory.
		
		5. write some documentation in "README.md"
		
		6. push to repo, install on jandbox.
		
	...then work out styling with unicorns: "Unicorn Retreat" #1!

		- very small
		- large, very large
		- on dark vs. light background

Icon font
How do I successfully pull out the demo code from the Icomoon package and get them to display w/ NYPL code?
OR,
maybe I should just link to that file from here, so I don't have to maintain too much crap, 
and I can replace that file whenever I add to NYPL Base's icon collection...
